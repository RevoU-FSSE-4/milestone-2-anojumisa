# AJ News App - Milestone 2 (RevoU Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp)
AJ News App is a milestone 2 project developed during the RevoU bootcamp. Itâ€™s a news application that allows users to explore news articles, filter by category, and search for specific topics. The app is built using React, TypeScript, and integrates with a news API.


## Explore news articles
Articles are fetched from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and displayed on the Homepage, Category Pages, and Search Results Page.

Here is the preview of the page:

## Filter by category 
Users can choose a category from the navbar to navigate to a dedicated page displaying news for that category.

## Search for specific topics 
A dedicated search section allows users to search for news based on keywords entered in the search bar. The search results are filtered using JavaScript's slice method to display only the top 5 results.

Here is the search results displayed upon completing the search:

## Subscribe (optional) 
Users can enter their email address in a subscription section. Upon submission, a modal popup (created with React Modal) thanks the user for subscribing. The email address is stored in localStorage (for potential future backend integration).
